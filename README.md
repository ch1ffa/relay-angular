## [Documentation](https://morrys.github.io/relay-angular/)

**the github page contains all the documentation relating to the libraries distributed by this monorepo.**

## Community challenge

The idea that led me to create this repository is to collect all the great work done by the community on github for react and react-native in order to create components and utilities that can be rendered anywhere.

If anyone is interested in sharing their idea, contact me (link in bio).
